# [Catena-X@Home](https://catenax-ng.github.io/docs/catenax-at-home-getting-started-guide)

This is the deployment project of the Catena-X@Home initiative.

It aims to provide an interconnected landscape of all Catena-X products in order to study their behaviour and embed your own products
into a playground before going live with the real platform.
